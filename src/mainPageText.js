                <h5>Our vision is to be:</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        a Christian people growing in a faith that is honest and life-changing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a centre for community at the heart of Caversham Heights.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a blessing and support to our neighbours locally and in the wider world.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Many churches do not allow women to have leadership roles, or they teach that homosexuality is wrong, but you would not know that just by visiting them. St Andrew's is a member of Inclusive Church, which campaigns against all forms of discrimination.</p>
                <p>The church is a group of people who are seeking to follow Jesus Christ in their individual and corporate lives. We try to do this through our worship, and by caring for each other and for our neighbours.</p>
                <br/>
